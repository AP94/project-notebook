# Design notebook for week ending November 23, 2014

## Description

X
Spent some time in office hours trying to get a working executable file; will have to wait on that.
Made minimal progress on the parser; it is failing to parse the name of the tiles, for some reason.
I might work on setting up the implementation of everything else in between wrestling with the parser.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
