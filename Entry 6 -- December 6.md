# Design notebook for week ending December 6, 2014

## Description

11/30/15
1:15-2:30

Fixed parsing!
The tile's sourcepath wasn't properly parsing
Fixed: parse "FOLDER"+"/" repeatedly, then parse "tilename" + file extension, where file extension is one of many options.
Currently: have ".jpg"
Will have to add more (unforunately; there may be a workaround, but for now, leave it be)

Placing tiles works!
Debug maps for placing tiles works!

To do: Fix fill commands
Better error handling!

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
