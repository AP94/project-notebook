# Design notebook for week ending November 9, 2014

## Description

###11/2/15

9:45-10:45

Trying to get the scala files set up.

Everything is almost working, the only problem is adding parsers; I have no clue how to add a jar file.
Or work eclipse at all, basically.

There's using "configue build path" which would be fine and dandy if scala-parser-combinators_2.11-1.0.4.jar was actually in the lib folder for External Piconot and not in Referenced Libraries which isn't accessible!
Fantastic.

_All I had to do was download the .jar file from the internet._

With that being said, perhaps I can find a nice way to add the library I found.



## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
